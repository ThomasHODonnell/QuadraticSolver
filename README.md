__Quadratic Solver__

This was my first project in CSC 1253, which was my intro to C++ course. 

_This program calculates the solutions, discriminate, axis of symmetry,
vertex, roots, and y intercepts of a quadratic function._

This is a very basic program, which handles program control, elementry arithmatic operations, and input validation. 

__How to Run?__

- Enter a valid quadratic equation, and the program will output the corresponding values listed above.
